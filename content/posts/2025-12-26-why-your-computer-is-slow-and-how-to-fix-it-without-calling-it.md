## Your Computer Shouldn't Take Forever

You know that feeling when you click something and then... wait. And wait. And your coffee gets cold while Windows decides whether or not it wants to open Excel today.

That's not normal. Or rather, it shouldn't be normal.

I talk to small business owners all the time who think slow computers are just "part of life." They're not. And you don't need to hire an IT person or buy a new computer to fix it.

Let me show you what's actually slowing you down and how to fix it yourself.

## The #1 Culprit: Too Many Programs Starting With Your Computer

Every time you install something, it wants to start automatically when your computer boots up. Spotify. Dropbox. That PDF reader. Microsoft Teams. Slack. That printer software from 2015.

Before you know it, 47 programs are trying to start at once, and your computer is crawling.

### How to Fix It (Windows)

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** (opens Task Manager)
2. Click the **Startup** tab
3. Look at the **Status** column - anything that says "Enabled" is starting with your computer
4. Right-click things you don't need immediately and choose **Disable**

**What to disable:**
- Spotify, iTunes, or music players (you can open them when you need them)
- Chat apps (Skype, Discord), unless you use them constantly
- Cloud storage sync apps (they'll still work, just won't start automatically)
- Printer software (printers will still work)
- Anything you don't recognize (Google it first)

**What NOT to disable:**
- Antivirus software
- Anything with "Windows" in the name
- Your VPN (if you use one for work)

### How to Fix It (Mac)

1. Click the Apple menu → **System Settings**
2. Go to **General** → **Login Items**
3. Look at what's starting automatically
4. Click the minus (-) button to remove things you don't need

You'll notice your computer starts up WAY faster after this.

## The #2 Problem: Your Hard Drive is Almost Full

Computers get slow when they're running out of space. Like really slow. If your hard drive is over 90% full, that's your problem.

### How to Check (Windows)

1. Open **File Explorer**
2. Click **This PC**
3. Look at your C: drive - is the bar almost full (red)?

### How to Check (Mac)

1. Click the Apple menu
2. Go to **About This Mac** → **Storage**
3. Look at the colored bar - is it almost full?

### Quick Fixes for Space:

**1. Empty your Downloads folder**
- Most people never clean this out
- You probably don't need that PDF from 2019

**2. Clear your Recycle Bin / Trash**
- Deleted files still take up space until you empty them
- Right-click the Recycle Bin and choose "Empty"

**3. Uninstall programs you never use**
- Windows: Settings → Apps → Installed apps
- Mac: Finder → Applications → drag to Trash

**4. Use Disk Cleanup (Windows only)**
- Search for "Disk Cleanup" in the Start menu
- Check all the boxes
- Click OK and wait

**For small business owners:** If you're storing years of old files, consider moving them to an external hard drive or cloud storage. You probably don't need every invoice from 2017 on your computer.

## The #3 Issue: Browser Tabs Are Eating Your Memory

I get it. You have 47 tabs open because you'll "read them later." Each tab uses memory. Enough tabs and your computer runs out of RAM.

### The Simple Fix:

Close tabs you're not using. Right now. Yes, all of them.

**Better solution:** Bookmark important pages instead of keeping tabs open.

**Windows:**
- Press **Ctrl + D** to bookmark the current page

**Mac:**
- Press **Command + D** to bookmark

**For small business owners:** If you have web-based tools you use daily (email, accounting software, CRM), bookmark them in a "Work" folder. Don't keep them open all day.

## The Security Stuff Small Business Owners Can't Ignore

Okay, switching gears for a minute. If you're running a small business, there are a few security things you NEED to do. Not "should do someday." Need to do today.

### 1. Update Your Computer (Seriously)

Those Windows Update notifications aren't just annoying. They're fixing security holes that hackers exploit.

**Windows:**
- Go to Settings → Windows Update
- Click "Check for updates"
- Install everything
- Restart when it asks (yes, really)

**Mac:**
- System Settings → General → Software Update
- Install all updates

**Set it and forget it:** Turn on automatic updates so you don't have to think about it.

### 2. Use Actual Antivirus Software

"But I'm careful about what I click!" Famous last words.

**Windows:** Windows Defender is built-in and free. Make sure it's running:
- Settings → Privacy & Security → Windows Security
- Click "Virus & threat protection"
- Make sure it says "No current threats."

**Mac:** Macs aren't immune anymore. Consider Malwarebytes (there's a free version).

**For small businesses:** If you handle customer data, credit cards, or anything sensitive, invest in a paid antivirus. It's cheaper than dealing with a breach.

### 3. Back Up Your Business Files

Not "I should do this." Do it TODAY.

If your computer dies tomorrow, can you keep running your business? If the answer is "no," you need backups.

**The simple way:**
- Buy an external hard drive (256GB+ for most small businesses)
- Plug it in
- Windows: Settings → System → Storage → "Configure Backup"
- Mac: Time Machine does this automatically when you plug in a drive

**The slightly better way:**
- Use cloud backup (Backblaze, Carbonite, or even Dropbox/Google Drive)
- It runs in the background
- If your computer dies, your files are safe

**What to back up:**
- Customer data
- Invoices and financial records
- Product photos
- Important documents
- Anything you'd cry about losing

### 4. Stop Using "Password123"

I know password management is annoying. But using the same password everywhere is like using the same key for your house, car, and office.

When one gets stolen, they're all compromised.

**The lazy solution that actually works:**
- Use your browser's built-in password manager
- Let it generate strong passwords
- You only need to remember ONE password (the one to unlock your computer)

**The better solution:**
- Use a password manager (Bitwist, 1Password, LastPass)
- About $3/month for a business plan
- Everyone on your team gets secure passwords
- When an employee leaves, you can revoke their access

**Minimum standard for business passwords:**
- At least 12 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- Different password for every important account
- Use two-factor authentication for email and banking

### 5. Secure Your Wi-Fi Network

If you run a business from an office (or home office), your Wi-Fi needs to be locked down.

**Check right now:**
1. Look at your Wi-Fi name - does it say "Linksys" or "NETGEAR-5G" or something generic?
2. Do you remember ever changing the router password from the default?

If you answered yes to #1 or no to #2, your network might not be secure.

**Quick security checklist:**
- Change your Wi-Fi password to something strong (not your business name + 123)
- Change your router's admin password (it's not the same as your Wi-Fi password)
- Don't use WEP encryption (it's ancient and broken - use WPA2 or WPA3)
- Hide your business Wi-Fi name if possible (prevents casual snooping)

**For businesses with a physical location:**
- Have separate Wi-Fi for customers vs. employees
- Never let customers access your business network
- Change the Wi-Fi password every 6 months

## The Quick Maintenance Checklist

Do these things monthly and your computer will stay fast:

**Every Month:**
- [ ] Empty Downloads folder
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data)
- [ ] Empty Recycle Bin / Trash
- [ ] Check for Windows/Mac updates
- [ ] Run a quick antivirus scan
- [ ] Check your backup actually ran

**Every 6 Months:**
- [ ] Review startup programs (disable anything new)
- [ ] Uninstall programs you never use
- [ ] Review what's taking up disk space
- [ ] Change important passwords (email, bank, business tools)
- [ ] Test your backup by trying to restore one file

**Once a Year:**
- [ ] Consider if you need a new computer (if it's 5+ years old, maybe)
- [ ] Review all business software subscriptions (are you still using them?)
- [ ] Update your router firmware (Google your router model + "update firmware")

## When to Actually Call Someone

Look, some problems need a professional. Call for help if:

- You get a message saying your files are encrypted and demanding payment (ransomware)
- Your computer won't turn on at all
- You smell burning or see smoke (unplug it immediately)
- You've tried everything here, and it's still unusably slow
- You got hacked and need to secure your business systems

But 80% of "slow computer" problems? You can fix them yourself with the steps above.

## The Real Cost of Slow Computers in Business

Here's something most small business owners don't think about: if your computer is slow, you're losing money.

Think about it:
- 5 extra minutes per day waiting for your computer = 20 hours per year
- At $50/hour, that's $1,000 in lost productivity
- Multiply that by every employee

Spending an hour to fix these issues pays for itself in a week.

Same with security: the cost of preventing problems is way less than the cost of fixing them after a breach. Backups are cheaper than losing all your customer data. Strong passwords are free.

## The Bottom Line

Your computer doesn't need to be slow. Most of the time, it's not the hardware - it's just accumulated junk and programs you forgot you installed.

Start with the startup programs. That's the #1 issue for 90% of people.

And if you're running a business, don't skip the security stuff. You might think "nobody wants to hack my small business," but attackers don't care how big you are. They're just looking for easy targets.

Make yourself a hard target with these simple steps, and you'll sleep better at night.

Plus, your computer will actually open Excel before your coffee gets cold.
