# Zero Trust for Small Teams: Practical Steps

Zero trust isnâ€™t just for big enterprises. In this post, we break down how small teams can adopt zero trust principles with practical, budget-friendly steps.

## Step 1: Identify Your Critical Assets
Know what you need to protect. Start with your most valuable data and systems.

## Step 2: Enforce Least Privilege
Give users only the access they need. Use built-in tools to manage permissions.

## Step 3: Monitor Everything
Set up simple logging and alerting. Free and open-source tools can go a long way.

## Step 4: Automate Responses
Use scripts to automatically block suspicious activity and notify your team.

## Step 5: Educate Your Team
Security is a team sport. Share best practices and run regular drills.
