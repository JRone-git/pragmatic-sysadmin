# About Pragmatic Sysadmin

Welcome to **Pragmatic Sysadmin** - where we cut through the tech jargon and focus on what actually works.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Home Networking**: Secure your Wi-Fi, set up proper DNS, create guest networks
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Practical cloud tips that save time and money
- **Automation**: Scripts and tools that actually solve real problems
- **Tool Reviews**: Hardware and software recommendations from someone who's tested them

## Why "Pragmatic"?

Because most tech blogs are either:
1. Too basic (restart your router!)
2. Too complex (here's how to compile your own kernel)

This blog lives in the sweet spot: **practical solutions for real-world problems**.
